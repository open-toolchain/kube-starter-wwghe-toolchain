template.name: "Develop a Bluemix app using IBM Whitewater and Cloud Foundry"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application, sourced from IBM Whitewater GitHub Enterprise. By default, the toolchain clones a sample Node.js “Hello World” app into a GHE repo, which you can then modify.  This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery through staging (YS1) and prod (YP), source control, issue tracking, Devops Insights and online editing.\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.  If an instance of that service isn’t already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. Check the pipeline to see it progressing through staging and production.
