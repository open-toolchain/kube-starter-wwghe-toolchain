### Continuously deliver a Docker app with IBM Whitewater GHE and Kubernetes

![Toolchain image](.bluemix/toolchain.png)

This template will configure a toolchain that can:
* build a Docker image from app source code, and secure it using Vulnerability Advisor
* orchestrate a Docker image deployments through a staging Kubernetes cluster and a production Kubernetes cluster (using distinct namespaces to allow sharing same cluster)
* provide cognitive insights to learn where you most need to improve your developer productivity, code quality, and delivery cycle times; as well as provide quality gates that will stop a deploy that doesnâ€™t cut the mustard.
* track code deployments back to GHE commits and issues --- TBD
* notify about delivery process in Slack
* allows to edit code online with WebIDE (but you can use desktop tools at your preference)

### To get started, click **Create toolchain**.
